# 🏗️ Architecture

IRIS-Instant follows a **modular architecture** separating concerns across layers:

1. **Frontend (Angular):** User interface for managing operations and workflows.
2. **Backend (Spring Boot):** RESTful APIs, business logic, and service orchestration.
3. **Database (PostgreSQL):** Structured data storage with optimized queries.
4. **DevOps Layer (Docker + Jenkins):** CI/CD automation for deployment and version control.

> The architecture ensures each layer can evolve independently while maintaining stability in production.
