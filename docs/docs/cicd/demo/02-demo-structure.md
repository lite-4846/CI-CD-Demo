title: "Project Structure"

This section explains the **folder layout** of the demo repository, giving you clarity on what each folder and file represents.  
While the core focus of this documentation is **CI/CD setup**, not the application code, understanding the structure will help you follow the Jenkins and Docker steps later.

EDIT : This structure is changed a little bit after adding support for Linux Setup with Full CI/CD Automation.

### High-Level Layout

```
D:\iris-code\ci-cd-demo\
├── angular/                # Frontend (Angular 17)
├── backend/                # Backend (Spring Boot 3)
├── artifacts/              # Build outputs generated by Jenkins
├── docs/                   # Documentation (this folder)
├── .env                    # Shared environment variables (used by backend + Jenkins)
├── default.conf            # Nginx configuration file
├── docker-compose.yml      # Multi-container orchestration for demo
├── iris-project-structure.txt
└── .gitignore
```

### Folder Details

#### **angular/**
- Contains the **Angular 17** application.  
- Uses **Tailwind CSS** for styling and Angular CLI for build configuration.
- Main build output directory: `dist/demo/browser`
- Key files:
  - `Dockerfile.frontend` – used to create the frontend image.
  - `Jenkinsfile.build` – Jenkins pipeline for Angular build.
  - `Jenkinsfile.image` – Jenkins pipeline for Docker image creation.
  - `package.json` – project dependencies.
  - `src/` – source code (components, services, routing).
  - `public/` – static assets.
  - `.vscode/` – editor configurations.

**Note:** We are **not focusing** on Angular internals here. The app is already complete and acts as the **frontend UI** for demonstrating the CI/CD process.

---

#### **backend/**
- Contains the **Spring Boot 3** REST API service.
- Uses Maven for dependency management and packaging.
- Exposes APIs under `/backend/api/`.
- Key files:
  - `Dockerfile.backend` – builds backend Docker image.
  - `Jenkinsfile.build` – Jenkins pipeline for building JAR.
  - `Jenkinsfile.image` – Jenkins pipeline for image creation.
  - `pom.xml` – Maven configuration file.
  - `src/main/java` – application code.
  - `target/demo-api-0.0.x.jar` – generated JAR file after build.

**Note:** Like frontend, we are **not diving into backend logic**. It’s a simple API service to demonstrate build → deploy → run pipeline flow.

---

#### **artifacts/**
- Acts as a **temporary storage** for build outputs.
- After Jenkins build stages, artifacts (JAR and frontend build) are copied here.
- Structure:
  - `artifacts/frontend/demo` → contains Angular build files.
  - `artifacts/backend/backend.jar` → compiled Spring Boot JAR.

---

#### **docs/**
- Contains all documentation for this demo project (the current section is part of it).
- Mirrors the structure of the CI/CD setup to make onboarding easy.

---

#### **default.conf**
- Nginx configuration file that:
  - Redirects `/` → `/demo`
  - Serves the Angular frontend from `/demo`
  - Proxies backend requests `/backend/api/` → backend container
  - Adds necessary CORS and HTTP headers

---

#### **docker-compose.yml**
- Defines and runs both frontend and backend containers together.
- Uses network `demo-net`.
- Exposes port `80` to the host system.

```
version: '3.8'
services:
  backend:
    image: demo-backend:3
    container_name: demo-backend
    env_file:
      - .env
    expose:
      - "8181"
    networks:
      - demo-net

  frontend:
    image: demo-frontend:22
    container_name: demo-frontend
    ports:
      - "80:80"
    networks:
      - demo-net

networks:
  demo-net:
    driver: bridge
```

---

#### **.env**
- Central configuration file storing shared environment variables.
- Used by:
  - Backend container (Spring Boot reads from it)
  - Jenkins pipelines (for consistent config)
- Example variables: DB credentials, ports, image names, version tags.

---

### Summary
- **Frontend:** Angular 17 + Tailwind, pre-built for CI/CD testing.  
- **Backend:** Spring Boot 3, exposes `/backend/api/`.  
- **Artifacts:** Temporary storage for Jenkins outputs.  
- **Nginx:** Single entry point for routing.  
- **Docker Compose:** Simplifies running entire stack locally.  

This structure ensures every part of the system is **self-contained, version-controlled, and pipeline-ready** for Jenkins automation.
