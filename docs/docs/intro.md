# 🧭 Introduction to CI/CD

Welcome to the **Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) Documentation**.  
This guide provides a complete reference for developers, DevOps engineers, and teams implementing automated build and deployment pipelines.

---

## 🚀 What is CI/CD?

**CI/CD** is the backbone of modern software delivery — a set of practices and tools that enable:
- **Continuous Integration:** Automatically building, testing, and validating code with every commit.  
- **Continuous Deployment:** Delivering tested code to production or staging environments automatically and reliably.

This documentation focuses on creating a **scalable, containerized, and automated pipeline** that accelerates development and ensures deployment consistency.

---

## 🧱 Core Stack

A practical CI/CD setup typically includes:

- **Frontend:** Angular 17+  
- **Backend:** Spring Boot (Java)  
- **Database:** PostgreSQL  
- **Automation & Deployment:** Docker + Jenkins  

These technologies demonstrate a complete pipeline from code commit to deployment, though the concepts apply to any modern tech stack.

## 📚 Documentation Overview

| Section | Description |
|----------|--------------|
| **CI/CD** | Step-by-step setup of Docker, Jenkins, and the full automation pipeline. |
| **Architecture** | High-level overview of the system design and integration points. |
| **Setup** | Environment preparation, prerequisites, and dependency configuration. |
| **Demo** | End-to-end walkthrough of the Angular + Spring Boot + PostgreSQL pipeline. |

> The focus of this documentation is **CI/CD implementation and automation**.

## 🧩 Goals

- Build a **reliable, reusable CI/CD pipeline** using Jenkins and Docker.  
- Simplify **local and remote deployment** through containerization.  
- Guarantee **consistency** across all environments.  
- Provide **clear, step-by-step documentation** for seamless onboarding.
